Hackers often need to download and install new software, as well as send and download multiple scripts and large files. These tasks are easier if these files are compressed and combined into a single file. If you come from the Windows world, you will probably recognize this concept from the .zip format, which combines and compresses files to make them smaller for transferring over the internet or removable media. There are many ways to do this in Linux, and we look at a few of the most common tools for doing so.

Compression, as the name implies, makes data smaller, thereby requiring less storage capacity and making the data easier to transmit.
Lossy compression is very effective in reducing the size of files, but the integrity of the information is lost. In other words, the file after compression is not exactly the same as the original. This type of compression works great for graphics, video, and audio files. .mp3, .mp4, and .jpg are all lossy compression algorithms.

Tarring Files Together
Note that by default, if an extracted file already exists, tar will remove the existing file and replace it with the extracted file.

-- Creating a Tarball --

kali >tar -cvf HackersArise.tar hackersarise1 hackersarise2 hackersarise3
hackersarise1
hackersarise2
hackersarise3

kali >ls -l
--snip--
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   40960 Nov 27 2018 13:32 HackersArise.tar

-- Display Files from the Tarball without Extracting --

kali >tar -tvf HackersArise.tar
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root         22311  Nov 27   2018 13:00 hackersarise1.sh

-- Extract Files from the Tarball --

kali >tar -xvf HackersArise.tar
hackersarise1.sh

hackersarise3.sh

kali >tar -xf HackersArise.tar


Linux commands capable of creating compressed files
These all are capable of compressing our files, but they use different compression algorithms and have different compression ratios

•   gzip, which uses the extension .tar.gz or .tgz
•   bzip2, which uses the extension .tar.bz2
•   compress, which uses the extension .tar.z


-- Compressing with gzip --

kali >gzip HackersArise.*

kali >ls -l
--snip--
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   3299 Nov 27 2018 13:32 HackersArise.tar.gz
--snip--

kali >gunzip HackersArise.*


-- Compressing with bzip2 --

kali >bzip2 HackersArise.*

kali >bunzip2 HackersArise.*
kali >


-- Compressing with compress --

You can also use the gunzip command with files that have been compressed with compress.

kali >compress HackersArise.*
kali >ls -l
--snip--
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5476 Nov 27 2018 13:32 HackersArise.tar.Z

kali >uncompress HackersArise.*



-- dd --

The dd command makes a bit-by-bit copy of a file, a filesystem, or even an entire hard drive. This means that even deleted files are copied, making for easy discovery and recovery.

dd if=inputfile of=outputfile

kali >dd if=/dev/sdb of=/root/flashcopy
1257441=0 records in
1257440+0 records out
7643809280 bytes (7.6 GB) copied, 1220.729 s, 5.2 MB/s

kali >dd if=/dev/media of=/root/flashcopy bs=4096 conv=noerror
