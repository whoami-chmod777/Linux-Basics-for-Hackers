If you are coming from a Windows environment, the  way that Linux represents and manages storage devices will look rather  different to you. You’ve already seen that the filesystem has no  physical representation of the drive, like the C:, D:, or E: system in Windows, but rather has a file tree structure with / at the top, or root, of it.

Mounting in this context simply means attaching drives or disks to the filesystem to make them accessible to the operating system (OS).

The Device Directory /dev
Linux has a special directory that contains files representing each attached device: the appropriately named /dev directory.

Each device on your system is represented by a file in the /dev directory, including devices you’ve probably never used or even realized existed. The devices sda1, sda2, sda3, sdb, and sdb1, are usually the hard drive and its partitions and a USB flash drive and its partitions.


-- How Linux Represents Storage Devices --

Originally, Linux represented floppy drives as fd0 and hard drives used IDE or E-IDE interface as hda, and SATA & SCSI hard drives are represented as sda.
When systems have more than one hard drive, Linux simply names them serially by incrementing the last letter in alphabetical order, so the first drive is sda, and the second drive is sdb, the third drive is sdc, and so on.

Device file    Description
sda            First SATA hard drive
sdb            Second SATA hard drive
sdc            Third SATA hard drive
sdd            Fourth SATA hard drive

Some drives can be split into partitions in order to manage and separate information. This way, the first partition on the first SATA drive would be sda1. The second partition would then be sda2, the third sda3, and so on.

Partition   Description
sda1        The first partition (1) on the first (a) SATA drive
sda2        The second (2) partition on the first (a) drive
sda3        The third (3) partition on the first (a) drive
sda4        The fourth (4) partition on the first (a) drive

New versions of Windows use an NTFS filesystem, whereas older Windows systems use File Allocation Table (FAT) systems. Linux uses a number of different types of filesystems, but the most common are ext2, ext3, and ext4.


-- Character and Block Devices --

Something else to note about the naming of device files in the /dev directory is that the first position contains either c or b.

crw-------   1   root root   10, 175   May 16   12:44 agpgart

These letters represent the two ways that devices transfer data in and out. The c stands for character, and these devices are known, as you might expect, as character  devices. External devices that interact with the system by sending and  receiving data character by character, such as mice or keyboards, are  character devices.
The b stands for the second type: block  devices. They communicate in blocks of data (multiple bytes at a time)  and include devices like hard drives and DVD drives. These devices  require higher-speed data throughput and therefore send and receive data  in blocks (many characters or bytes at a time).

-- Mounting and Unmounting --

A storage device must be first physically connected to the filesystem and then logically attached to the filesystem in order for the data to be made available to the operating system. The point in the directory tree where devices are attached is known as the mount point. The two main mount points in Linux are /mnt and /media.
The mount point for the device should be an empty directory; if you mount a device on a directory that has subdirectories and files, the mounted device will cover the contents of the directory, making them invisible and unavailable.


-- Mounting & Unmounting Storage Devices --

[new hard drive]
kali >mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
kali >umount /dev/sdb1

[flash drive]
kali >mount /dev/sdc1 /media
